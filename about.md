## Goalixa Story

Goalixa started as a personal idea for time management. I needed a real project to learn modern tools deeply, so I built it first as a local project. As it improved, I decided to make it public so everyone can use it for free.

- Flask
- Kubernetes
- k3s
- Traefik
- HTML/CSS
- Harbor

Most Goalixa services have been developed with AI-assisted workflows, which helped accelerate feature delivery. The core mission of this project is deep infrastructure learning, better design patterns, and stronger system design thinking.
