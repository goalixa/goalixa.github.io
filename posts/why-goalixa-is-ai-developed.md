# Why Most Goalixa Code Is AI-Developed

> **Published:** 2026-02-20 | **Section:** Engineering Mindset

One of my core beliefs is that in today’s world, we do not always need to type every line of code ourselves when AI can help generate, reason about, and implement faster.

For Goalixa, I intentionally chose an AI-first development style.

## Why I Chose This Direction

- I want to move faster on product iteration.
- I want to spend more time on architecture decisions, not repetitive coding.
- I want to test what happens when AI is used as a serious engineering teammate.

## My Main Learning Goal

One of my biggest goals in Goalixa is learning system design and better engineering decisions.

I prefer focusing on:

- System design
- DevOps tooling
- Monitoring and reliability
- Network and platform architecture

instead of spending most of my time on frontend implementation details.

Maybe this approach is wrong in some parts, but I want to validate it through real experience.

## What I Learned from Early Days

In the beginning, the codebase grew quickly inside a monolithic app.  
As features increased, I started seeing slowdowns and instability risks.

That experience pushed me toward microservice thinking, where responsibilities are clearer and system boundaries are easier to evolve.

## My Current View

AI-first coding is valuable for my current stage because it gives me more space to think about:

- Long-term architecture
- Reliability under growth
- Better operational workflows

Goalixa is my practical lab to test this mindset with real trade-offs, not only theory.
